                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Kingston United Cricket Club was founded with a vision to bring together passionate cricketers in Kingston under one banner. What began as a simple idea — to create a true leather-ball cricket club — has quickly grown into a vibrant community of players committed to discipline, teamwork, and excellence.</p>
                <p>From our early beginnings, the club has become a space where players from different backgrounds, regions, and cultures come together, united by their love for the game. Our journey is one of building not just a cricket team, but a cricketing culture in Kingston — one that inspires young players, welcomes experienced cricketers, and creates lasting memories both on and off the field.</p>
